3D printers are revolutionizing the way assistive devices and prosthetics are created and developed. Before their arrival, the process of creating these devices was lengthy, costly, and limited by available materials. With the advent of 3D printers, the development of these devices has become more accessible, faster, and efficient.
- ➡️ Firstly, 3D printers allow for custom production of prosthetics and assistive devices. Patients can obtain prosthetics and devices that fit their specific needs perfectly, significantly improving their quality of life. Additionally, the ability to customize allows healthcare professionals to offer unique solutions for each patient, leading to more effective results.
- ➡️ Secondly, 3D printers have significantly reduced the time and cost of developing these devices. 3D printing allows for real-time production of parts and components, meaning patients can receive their devices much faster than before. Additionally, 3D printing allows for low-cost prototype creation, enabling healthcare professionals to test and improve designs before mass production.
- ➡️ Finally, 3D printers are enabling research and development of new materials and technologies in the field of assistive and prosthetic devices. The ability to print with advanced materials such as metals and smart polymers means that healthcare professionals can create stronger, lighter, and more comfortable devices for their patients.

In conclusion, 3D printers are having a significant impact on the development of assistive devices and prosthetics. Customization, efficiency, and ongoing research are improving the quality of life for people with disabilities and helping healthcare professionals offer innovative solutions for their patients.

### ✅ Abstract:
- Approximately 215,156 people in Ecuador grapple with physical disabilities, of whom nearly half fall within the 30 to 49% disability range, and a considerable number lack limbs. Moreover, there's been a surge in amputation cases, a trend linked to the increasing diabetes prevalence estimated at around 537 million cases by 2021 as per the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). While prosthetic solutions exist, they might incur high costs or offer constrained movement, even when more affordable. Thus, an alternative is proposed: a myoelectric upper limb prosthesis. This prosthesis would be maneuvered through electromyography and pulse oximetry signals, leveraging artificial intelligence methods. Employing a multi-layer neural network model, a structure comprising an input layer, four hidden layers, and an output layer, yields an impressive 93% prediction accuracy for user movement intentions. For AI model training, data from EMG and PPG sensors were recorded and scrutinized, leading to the condensation of classes from four to three. The model was embedded within an ESP32 C3 DevKit-M1 development board, and open-source blueprints facilitated the prosthesis's creation, complemented by supplementary components for electronics integration. The model attains a 93% precision in predicting classes, while the prosthesis's endurance spans approximately three hours and costs $295, equipped to handle diverse lightweight objects.
